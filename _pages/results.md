<span style="font-size:medium;">Twelve human subjects, and our model, the Social MDP, watched and scored 144 videos at different snapshots. These videos consist of 72 scenarios where robots reason at either level 1 or level 2 (presented to the users in randomized order). Models and humans were asked to predict the social and physical goal of the agents and their confidence of the interaction at different time steps of the video. The straight black line represents the best linear fit to the data, and the light blue band around the line shows the uncertainty in the linear fit. The light blue band represents a 95% confidence interval.</span>
